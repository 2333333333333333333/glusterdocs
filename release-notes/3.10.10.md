## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release
**No Major changes**

## Major issues

1. FIXED: Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption

   Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes were
   expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance) there
   are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
   The last known cause for corruption (#1498081) is still fixed with this
   release.

2. Brick multiplexing is being tested and fixed aggressively but we still have a
   few crashes and memory leaks to fix.
