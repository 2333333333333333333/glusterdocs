#Tuning your _thingamabob_

This template is for recommendations on how to configure software given a certain configuration. Unlike the procedural topics, which describe what to do, this kind of topic is opinionated and describes what you _should_ do.

## Prerequisites

What state does their system have to be in for tuning to be useful? 
What do you expect the person reading this to know?

If they need to know their bandwidth, throughput, disk space, or office phone number, tell them about it here.

## Configuration style 1
Briefly describe the environment you expect. If there is a setting that means they should never do this tuning, use a 
CAUTION: note to alert them.
