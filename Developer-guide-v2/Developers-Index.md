Getting Started
===============

Here are a number of starting points for getting involved with the Gluster community. We don't require a signed contributor license agreement or
copyright assignment, but we do require a "signed-off-by" line on each code check-in.

---------------

## Source code repo

   The various gluster repositories are available in the [Gluster organization](https://github.com/gluster) in Github. However, this document will deal only with the [main gluster repository](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs).


## License information

   Gluster is free software and is dual licensed under [GPLV2](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/master/COPYING-GPLV2) and [LGPLV3+](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/master/COPYING-LGPLV3).

##  Mailing lists

Gluster development discussions happen on the [gluster-devel@gluster.org](gluster-devel@gluster.org) mailing list.
All others happen on the [gluster-users@gluster.org](gluster-users@gluster.org) mailing list.
